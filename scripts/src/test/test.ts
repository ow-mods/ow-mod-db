The ones noticeable to players are:\r\n  - Previously, receiving a non-unique filler item (marshmallow, oxygen refill, fuel refill) after switching profiles would have no effect. This should be fixed now.\r\n  - Reaching Feldspar via Signalscope is now in logic. Previously there was a bug causing only the Scout method to be in logic.\r\n  - When you connect to a multiworld made with a different .apworld version from the mod version, the warning message now appears in the in-game console without having to pause first, so it should be harder to miss\r\n  - When the mod tries to check a location but the AP server times out, it now prints a warning to the in-game console (not just the OWML logs), so it's easier to tell there's a connection issue beyond the mod's control\r\n- Additional tweaks since the Release Candidate:\r\n  - The logsanity location \"ET Ship Log: Sunless City 3 - Signal\" now correctly requires Ghost Matter Wavelength\r\n  - Made mid-game communication with the AP server non-blocking. That means the game will no longer freeze for up to 2 seconds whenever it tries to tell the AP server you checked a location (this is usually only noticeable if the server is down).\r\n  - Rewrote README instructions for installing old or prerelease versions of the mod now that I've become aware of and tested more Outer Wilds Mod Manager features.",
